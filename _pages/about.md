Hello! I'm a third year student at the [University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill](https://www.unc.edu/) studying Computer Science and Economics with a minor in Statistics.

My academic journey has been deeply influenced by my participation in a variety of research projects. I've investigated hospital performance managment, lithium-ion battery health estimation for electric vehicles, and most recently data movement on supercomputers at [Argone National Laboratory](https://www.anl.gov/).

These experiences have led me to develop a deep interest in data science, with a specific focus on how machine/deep learning can be applied in science and industry. I explore these passions through personal projects that can be found on my [GitHub!](https://github.com/JaySakarvadia)

Apart from academics, I love to listen to music, travel, and spend time in the gym.

Feel free to reach out to me using any of the social links located at the top left of this page!
